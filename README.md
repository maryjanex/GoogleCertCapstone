Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study
Course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone 
# Introduction
In this case study, I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, along with some key team members as their junior data analyst. To answer the business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. 
# Background
Cyclistic, a Chicago bike-share program, aims to convert casual riders (single-ride or day-pass users) into annual members. To achieve this, they need a deeper understanding of the differences between these two groups. By analyzing historical bike trip data, they can identify trends and tailor marketing strategies to appeal to casual riders and encourage them to become annual members.
# Ask
Three questions to guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
Moreno has assigned me the first question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
# Prepare
I will use Cyclistic's historical trip data to analyze and identify trends, I downloaded the previous 12 months of trip data from November 2023 to October 2024. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license. https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement
